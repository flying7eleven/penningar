Penningar (_Swedish for "money"_) is a Rust-based tool designed to help you import and analyze your bank account statements locally.
By leveraging the official APIs of supported banks, Penningar ensures secure and accurate data handling while staying within the bounds of modern Rust practices.

This project draws inspiration from tools like YNAB but is more of a learning exercise and fun side project rather than a fully polished, production-grade solution.
Penningar is a step towards creating an open-source alternative for personal financial management, with privacy and local control at its core.

Whether you're looking to track your spending, visualize your cash flow, or just experiment with financial data analysis, Penningar is here to help â€” albeit with no guarantees of completeness or stability as development progresses.
